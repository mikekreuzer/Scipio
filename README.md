# Scipio

Scipio was written in Python to script the download & build of Cocoa frameworks.

Swift has its own native dependency manager, like the rest of Swift it's not quite ready to use in anger. One day. 

See one of the earlier tags for the code, cleaned up here in case anyone's still counting lines of code by language.
